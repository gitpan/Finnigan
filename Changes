        - optimisations for speed in all decoder objects
        - new object, Finnigan::Scan, provides a lightweight
          decoder for scan data that takes just two file reads to
          decode the profile and the centroid list.
        - more test coverage; the most essential manoeuvres
          for reading scan data are now represented.
        - complete documentation of all modules
